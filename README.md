## 🚀 What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is built on top of Starlette (for web handling) and Pydantic (for data validation).

- Creating your first FastAPI app

### 3. Routing and Endpoints
- Defining GET, POST, PUT, DELETE routes
- Path and query parameters

### 4. Request Body and Data Models
- Using Pydantic for request validation
- Creating and using data models

### 5. CRUD Operations
- Implementing basic Create, Read, Update, Delete logic
- Handling data in-memory and with databases

### 6. Database Integration
- Connecting to databases using SQLAlchemy
- Creating models and sessions

### 7. Authentication and Authorization
